This test displays a black and a white screen in turns while a trigger signal is given on every turn at LPT1. 
The frequency can be changed by editing the dur_wait variable in the INFO file.

Presing the "P" key will pause the fikkering while "R" will resume it. "Q" is for quit.
The scenario uses the enter key as response button and LPT1 as the output port.

This script is changed to count the pulses it generates while sending the same amount of screen refreshes.
By comparing the two numbers we can tell something about the missed frames
